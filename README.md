#Autodesk View And Data Rest API Wrapper Library for .Net Applications and ASP.Net websites


##Description

*This sample is part of the [Developer-Autodesk/Autodesk-View-and-Data-API-Samples](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/autodesk-view-and-data-api-samples) repository.*

A .Net library that contains a C# wrapper for the Autodesk View And Data API. The wrapper is using RestSharp and allows easy integration of the View And Data Rest API inside any .Net application: desktop or ASP.Net-based website. Examples of using the library are available in the workflow projects.

##Dependencies

The wrapper is using async methods, so .Net 4.5 is required to use the library. The latest version of RESTSharp is available from http://restsharp.org/.

##Setup/Usage Instructions

*Compile the project or include it inside your own solution if you wish to customize the source code
*Reference the dll from any .Net 4.5 compatible project (Winform, WPF, Asp.Net, ...)
*A good example on how to use the lib can be found in this project: [workflow-wpf-view.and.data.api](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/workflow-wpf-view.and.data.api)
