##Description

*This sample is part of the [Developer-Autodesk/Autodesk-View-and-Data-API-Samples](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/autodesk-view-and-data-api-samples) repository.*

A .Net library that contains a C# wrapper for the Autodesk View And Data API. The wrapper is using RestSharp and allows easy integration of the View And Data Rest API inside any .Net application: desktop or ASP.Net-based website. Examples of using the library are available in the workflow projects.

##Dependencies

The wrapper is using async methods, so .Net 4.5 is required to use the library. The latest version of RESTSharp is available from http://restsharp.org/.
